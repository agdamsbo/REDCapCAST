```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(REDCapCAST)
```

To make the easiest possible transition from spreadsheet/dataset to REDCap, I have created a small Shiny app, which adds a graphical interface to the casting of a data dictionary and data upload. Install the package and run the app as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
require(REDCapCAST)
shiny_cast()
```

The app will launch in a new window and the interface should be fairly self-explanatory.
The app only provides the most basic functionality, but might be extended in the future.
