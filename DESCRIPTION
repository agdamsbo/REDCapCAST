Description: This is a fork of REDCapRITS by Paul Egeler and Spectrum Health. See
    [https://github.com/SpectrumHealthResearch/REDCapRITS](https://github.com/SpectrumHealthResearch/REDCapRITS).
    Split REDCap repeating instruments output into multiple tables. 
    This will take raw output from a REDCap export and split it into a base table
    and child tables for each repeating instrument. 
    REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software
    platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing
    1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for
    tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export
    procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and
    4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources
